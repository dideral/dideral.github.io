          <h3>The CTR-Test®</h3>
          <p>The functioning of the CTR-Test® is based on the principle of exclusion. This laboratory examination tests
            which chemotherapeutic agents do not influence the growth of the tumor on the basis of alive, surgically
            removed tumor material. Whether a drug is ineffective is checked for each patient individually. Therefore
            the probability to find an individually effective drug is increased. This saves the patient from unnecessary
            side effects and predictable failure of therapies. As a result, valuable time for treatment is gained and
            cross resistances to otherwise effective therapies are avoided. Ineffective drugs do not need to be
            administered and costs for ineffective therapies do not incur.</p>


          <div class="img" style="background: url('startup/common-files/img/header/optimierte.jpg') 50% 80% no-repeat;" ></div>
          <h6>How to Do the Test: 5 Easy Steps to Achieve Best Therapy</h6>
          <p>1. For testing, the laboratory requires tumor material from the patient. A transport kit is provided for
            shipping the tumor. The kit should be present before the tumor is removed.</p>
          <p>2. Ordering of the transport kit</p>
          <p>3. Removal of the tumor and return on the same day</p>
          <p>4. Test performance at the laboratory</p>
          <p>5. The test result will be transmitted to the treating physician 7-9 days after the tumor arrives at the
            laboratory
            Decision on the treatment regimen with the help of the test result</p>
          <br>
            <h6>Who profits from the CTR-Test®? </h6>
            <p>In principle, the test is applicable to all types of solid tumors. Solid tumors are those that originate
              in different organs. The most frequently tested types of cancer are breast cancer, colorectal cancer,
              cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer and sarcomas.</p>

          <h3>The Test Result for the Right Medication</h3>
          <p>The CTR-Test® uncovers which chemotherapeutic agents are ineffective for an individual patient with more
            than 95% accuracy.The result is clear and easy to interpret. It includes a diagram which shows the effect of
            the tested substances on the tumor cells. The result is interpreted according to the level of
            resistance:</p>
          <br>

            <ul style="list-style: square;" >
              <li style="list-style: square;" ><p><b>Extreme Resistance (ER):</b> Tumor cell growth could not be
                inhibited compared to an untreated control. Therapy failure is most likely to expect, if that drug is
                used.</p></li>
              <li style="list-style: square;" ><p><b>Medium Resistance (MR):</b> Tumor cell growth was only partly
                inhibited. There is an increased probability for therapy failure.</p>
              </li>
              <li style="list-style: square;" ><p><b>Slight Resistance (SR):</b> Tumor cell growth was strongly
                inhibited. These chemotherapeutic agents are most likely to be effective.
              </p>
              </li>
              <br>
            </ul>


            <div class="blog-3-sub" ></div>
            <p>It is usually possible to choose a number of drugs for a chemotherapeutic treatment. Medication depends
              on many factors: Type of tumor, origin and advance of the disease, number of prior treatments, side
              effects of other drugs and of course the individual condition of the patient as well as guidelines, study
              results and drug approval. Ineffective substances are excluded through the test. A more effective kind of
              treatment can be selected from the range of possible standard therapies. The CTR-Test® has the greatest
              benefit, if several standard therapies exist.</p>
            <p>The CTR-Test® result shows the physician which chemotherapeutic agents are ineffective. Therefore he can
              administer an alternative and effective chemotherapy. If the patient is saved from unnecessary side
              effects, the quality of life can be improved.

          <h3>Innovative Test Procedure for a Valid Result</h3>
          <p>After receipt of the tumor material, the CTR-Test® provides a valid result after only eight steps:</p>


          <ul style="list-style: square;" >
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>At first, fresh, alive tumor tissue is cut and digested by enzymes in
              order to obtain the tumor suspension with is necessary for analysis.
            </p></li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>Tumor cells are kept under conditions, which favor growth of tumor cells
              and suppress growth of other, irritating cells.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>Under these carefully controlled growth conditions, cells are exposed to
              the desired chemotherapeutic agents for five days.

            </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>Radioactively labeled thymidine is added to the cells for the last two
              days to be able to accurately determine cell growth later. Tumor cells grow differently strong during this
              period of time (extreme, medium and slight level of cell growth).

            </p></li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>After these two days newly built, radioactively labeled DNA is obtained.

            </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>Radioactive signals are measured and used to determine cell growth.


            </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>The growth of cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents is compared to
              the growth of an untreated control group.

            </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>During the last step, the effectiveness of each drug is compared to
              those in the data base. In this way the degree of resistance is determined.


            </p>
            </li>
            <br>
          </ul>

          <p>Highly reliable predictions of ineffectiveness of drugs distinguish the CTR-Test® from other testing
            procedures, which use alive tumor cells. Classification as ER (extreme resistance) is more than 95%
            accurate.</p>


      </div>

      <div id="study" class="tab-pane fade" >
        <br><br>
          <h3>CTR-Test® – More than 95 % Reliability</h3>
          <p>The CTR-Test® has been performed more than 150,000 times. Therefore it is the leading method to identify
            ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents before they are administered and to determine the best
            chemotherapy for the patient.</p>
          <p>For the validation of the CTR-Test® the following studies were conducted:</p>


          <ul style="list-style: square;" >
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>17 clinical studieson the CTR-Test® with more than 2,000 patients
              underpin the relevance and the benefit of the CTR-Test® for patients.
            </p></li>
            <li style="list-style: square;" ><p>The CTR-Test® has been validated by ten additional studies on tumor
              material of more than 20,000 patients.
            </p>
            </li>

            <br>
          </ul>

          <p>For this reason, the CTR-Test® is definitely no experimental method, but an established standard
            procedure.</p>
